  description: '<p>A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He cares about tradition, loyalty, and order but not about freedom, dignity, or life. He plays by the rules but without mercy or compassion. He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. He is loath to break laws or promises.</p><p>This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.</p><p>Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master.</p><p>Lawful evil is sometimes called "diabolical", because devils are the epitome of lawful evil.</p><p>Lawful evil creatures consider their alignment to be the best because it combines honor with a dedicated self-interest.</p><p>Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.</p><p></p>',

  description: '<p>A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn\'t feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she\'s not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.</p><p>Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.</p><p>Neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.</p><p>Neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it represents apathy, indifference, and a lack of conviction.</p>',

He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.</p><p>Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it represents true freedom from both society\'s restrictions and a do-gooder\'s zeal.</p><p>Chaotic neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to eliminate all authority, harmony, and order in society.</p>',

If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.</p><p>Chaotic evil is sometimes called "demonic" because demons are the epitome of chaotic evil.</p><p>Chaotic evil beings believe their alignment is the best because it combines self-interest and pure freedom.</p><p>Chaotic evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents the destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the order on which beauty and life depend.</p>',
